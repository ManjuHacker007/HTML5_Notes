we have heading 1 to heading 6
total 6 range of headings

<h1> means most important heading also biggest
<h6> is least important heading also smallest

<h1> heading 1 </h1> - this is how we write the code

correct structure of heading's is important,
normally in a web-page we use only 1 <h1> tag.
and all other heading's will be <h2> to <h6>
